Behind other important things in life, teaching and computer science are my favorites. I find so much beauty in progaramming, and I want to share that beauty with others in my work. I have long been a fan of Brilliant and other online education platforms, and some of my personal heroes are Sal Khan and Grant Sanderson.  I look up to the work they've done and what they've provided to the global community of curious people.  I want to follow that passion myself as well.
