I'm writing about the \position{} position at \company{}. This
position excites me because I love creating courses and content --
especially related to technology.  Part of why it matters to me is
because it has had a huge impact on my life and career, and I want
other people to feel the fulfillment and pride that comes from
learning technology. I remember before I was a programmer, when I
saw people have an IDE open, I thought it was so cool, and now
here I am on the other side with an VSCode open all day.

I didn't start out in technology -- I found it on my own, realized
how much I liked it, and the rest was history.  Since then, I have
worked various jobs related to programming and technology, and taught
a data analytics class as well. Furthermore, I've given talks at MeetUps
and created my own educational content on YouTube, GeoGebra, Medium,
and other channels.

I've been a financial quant at Security Benefit for 18 months. While I've learned
a lot, I miss the direct interaction with people and the chance to spark interest
in technology. I want to be in a role that combines my technical skills with
community engagement.  For example, when I taought the data analytics
course, I could feel that I was helping the students grow a passion for
programming and start to feel empowered and that they actually could learn
it.

As a \position{}, I plan to write clear documentation, create straightforward
tutorials, and present at conferences. Listening to customers and relaying their
feedback to our developers is a priority for me. Being a developer, I understand
the technical side and aim to bridge the gap between our team and our users effectively.

Thank you for considering my application. I would be happy to discuss
how I can be a core member of the team at Chegg and help our students
thrive.
